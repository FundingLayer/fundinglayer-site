**Funding Layer (FDLY) Whitepaper**

*Version 1.0 | July 2025*

---

### Introduction

**Funding Layer (FDLY)** is a decentralized protocol that revolutionizes how early-stage projects are funded by shifting the investment model from apps to builders. Instead of backing a single product, investors support the long-term success of the creator. This approach diversifies risk, incentivizes early believers, and empowers builders to innovate sustainably.

---

### Problem Statement

1. **High Failure Rates:** \~90% of early-stage startups fail.
2. **Difficult to Identify Winners:** Investors lack tools to vet early builders.
3. **No Incentive for Early Support:** Returns are tied to product success, not the builder.

These issues result in wasted capital, discouraged builders, and short-term funding models.

---

### The Funding Layer Solution

Funding Layer introduces a builder-first, tokenized funding ecosystem:

- Investors purchase **builder-specific tokens**.
- Tokens are sold via **bonding curves** or direct sales.
- Builders deploy apps; revenue is distributed via **splits contracts** to token holders.

---

### How It Works

1. **Builder Onboarding:**

   - Apply via FundingLayer.xyz
   - Verified through:
     - **Karma Gap Profile** (onchain footprint)
     - **Talent Passport Score** (Web3 credentials, GitHub, community)
     - Community curation and DAO shortlisting

2. **Tokenization:**

   - Builders issue their own token or use \$FDLY-backed revenue shares
   - Investors buy in early
   - Token value rises with builder reputation and success

3. **Revenue Splits:**

   - Smart contracts distribute yield or retroactive rewards from builder apps to token holders
   - Payments made in \$FDLY or \$SOL

4. **Governance:**

   - Future DAO will vote on:
     - Builder listings
     - Funding pool usage
     - Protocol upgrades

### FAQs

**Q: How is this different from other launchpads?**\
